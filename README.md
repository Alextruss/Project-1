# Milestone Project 1 - Alex Truss 

## Portfolio site
[Click here](https://alextruss.github.io/Project-1/) for the live site.

The aim of this project was to build a portfolio website for myself as a place to show off the progress of my course and showcase my portfolio pieces as i go along. The end game for the site is to be the basis of my portfolio and online presence going forwards. The site will be an access point to information about myself and a way to contact me through a range of options, such as email, phone and social media.
