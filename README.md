## Portfolio site
[Click here](https://alextruss.github.io/Project-1/) for the live site.

The aim of this project was to build a portfolio website for myself as a place to show off the progress of my course and showcase my portfolio pieces as i go along. The end game for the site is to be the basis of my portfolio and online presence going forwards. The site will be an access point to information about myself and a way to contact me through a range of options, such as email, phone and social media.

## User Experience (UX)
First time visitor goals
<ul>
<li>Immediatly understand what the message of the site is.
<li>Easily navigate the site using navbar and return to top buttons.
<li>Allow visitors to contact me regrding current work and possile commisions.
</ul>

Returning visitor goals
<ul>
<li>Allow visitors to visit my portfolio to browse new work.
<li>Allow visitors to access my new social media links.
</ul>

## Design

I decided early on that the site needed to be a single page design to make it easier for mobile navigation. It will be a responsive design to allow it to seemlessly transition between mobile devices and desktop/laptop PC's. The site navigation will be located at the top, with links to return to top situated in each secton of the site.

### Wireframe

I want to stck with a minialistic design, using greys, white and blue as my colour scheme.

## Technologies Used

<ul>
<li>HTML 5
<li>CSS
<li>Java Script
<li>Bootstrap for responsive design and page componants
<li>Google fonts for additional font used on the site
</ul>

## Testing
My site has been tested on both desktops and a range of mobile phones.
I have cross platform tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari as well as both samsungs and Huawei's default browsers. 
I forwarded the link and screenshots taken on my device,to 3 peers who I knew had different mobile devices. One an Iphone 12, One a Samsung S20 and the third a Huawei P30 Pro. I Asked them to rely with answers to 3 questions:
<ol>
<li> Does the site display on your device in a similar manor to the screenshots in terms of layout and content?
<li> Did you find it easy to understand and navigate the site?
<li> Did all navigation links, both at the top and in the contact me section work correctly?
</ol>

All three responded yes to each question.

The final site was tested and validated with [WC3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [WC3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Both returned fully validated with the exception of a few warnings regarding some of the Bootstrap style. I was told this is expected and does not effect my code.

## Deployment and cloning

To create and publish my project I used Github to create the repositories. This projects repository can be found at https://github.com/Alextruss/Project-1 

To clone the repository you will need to access this link, then Select the code button. This will give you access to clone the repository or download a zip copy of the repository.
